# CLO3D MCP Server

Talk to CLO3D from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client. Create patterns, swap fabrics, run simulations, export models. All from a chat window.

If you use CLO3D and you've wished you could script repetitive tasks without digging through the API docs, this is for you.

```
Your AI assistant  <-->  MCP Server  <-->  CLO3D Plugin  <-->  CLO3D
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Load the plugin in CLO3D

One Python file, no dependencies.

1. Open CLO3D
2. **Script > Script Editor**
3. Open `plugin/clo3d_mcp_plugin.py`
4. Hit **Run**

You'll see `[CLO MCP] Plugin started` in the console.

### 2. Connect your AI client

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add clo3d -- uvx clo3d-mcp
```

**Claude Desktop** (add to `claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clo3d": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["clo3d-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Go

Ask things like:
- *"What patterns are in this project?"*
- *"Set the front bodice fabric to red"*
- *"Run 100 steps of simulation then export as GLB"*
- *"Export a turntable of all colorways"*

## How it works

Two pieces:

**The plugin** (`plugin/clo3d_mcp_plugin.py`) runs inside CLO3D. It's a single Python file that polls a shared temp directory for JSON commands, calls the CLO3D Python API, and writes results back. No external dependencies, no sockets, works with CLO3D's built-in Python.

**The MCP server** (`src/clo3d_mcp/`) is a Python package that writes commands to that directory and reads responses. Any MCP-compatible client (Claude, Cursor, etc.) can use it.

```
┌─────────────────┐   file-based IPC  ┌──────────────────┐     CLO3D API     ┌────────┐
│   MCP Server    │ ◄──────────────► │   CLO3D Plugin    │ ◄──────────────► │ CLO3D  │
│   (clo3d-mcp)   │  %TEMP%/clo3d_mcp │  (Python script)  │                  │        │
└─────────────────┘                   └──────────────────┘                  └────────┘
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot find CLO3D communication directory"**: Is CLO3D running? Did you run the plugin script?

**Plugin errors**: Check the Script Editor console in CLO3D for Python tracebacks.

**Simulation/export timeout**: These can take a while. The default timeout is 180 seconds.

**Custom comm directory**: Set the `CLO3D_MCP_DIR` environment variable to override the default shared directory path.

## Requirements

- CLO3D with Python scripting support
- Python 3.10+
- uv or pip

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ubani-Studio/clo3d-mcp.git
cd clo3d-mcp

# Install dev dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run tests (no CLO3D needed, uses a mock server)
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Run the MCP server locally
uv run clo3d-mcp
```
